Here is a detailed list of the software that you will need to install on the Raspberry Pi Zeros to support your Dog Tracker project, including the relevant tools for managing Bluetooth beacons, the Wi-Fi mesh network, data storage, and analytics. This will also serve as a foundation for planning your GitHub Actions CI/CD pipelines.

1. Operating System
Raspberry Pi OS (Lite version recommended for headless setup): A lightweight Linux-based OS that provides the base environment for all software.
Installation via standard Raspberry Pi image flashing tools (e.g., Raspberry Pi Imager or Etcher).

2. Bluetooth Management
BlueZ: The official Bluetooth stack for Linux, allowing you to scan for and interact with Minew Bluetooth beacons.

Installation:
bash
Copy code
sudo apt-get install bluez
pybluez: A Python library to interact with Bluetooth devices for scanning, reading RSSI values, and other operations.

Installation:
bash
Copy code
sudo pip3 install pybluez
aioblescan: A Python library for asynchronously scanning BLE devices, useful for managing multiple Bluetooth devices and tags.

Installation:
bash
Copy code
sudo pip3 install aioblescan

3. Wi-Fi Mesh Networking
B.A.T.M.A.N. Advanced: A mesh networking protocol for Linux, which allows your Raspberry Pi Zeros to form a Wi-Fi mesh network and communicate with each other.

Installation:
bash
Copy code
sudo apt-get install batctl
dnsmasq (optional): Lightweight DNS forwarder and DHCP server to manage IP addresses in your mesh network.

Installation:
bash
Copy code
sudo apt-get install dnsmasq

4. Data Collection and Messaging
MQTT Broker: For lightweight, real-time communication between Raspberry Pi Zeros and the central server. You can either run an MQTT broker on each Pi or use a central broker.
Installation (using Mosquitto):
bash
Copy code
sudo apt-get install mosquitto mosquitto-clients

5. Data Processing
Node-RED: A flow-based tool for integrating and orchestrating IoT data from sensors and beacons. It can be used for managing data flows and integrating with InfluxDB.

Installation:
bash
Copy code
bash <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/node-red/linux-installers/master/deb/update-nodejs-and-nodered)
Python: For writing custom scripts to handle triangulation, RSSI collection, and Bluetooth interactions.

Pre-installed on Raspberry Pi OS.

6. Database (Optional for Edge Storage)
InfluxDB (optional): If you want to collect and store time-series data directly on the Pi Zeros, InfluxDB can be used. However, if data is sent to a central instance, this might not be needed on each Pi.
Installation:
bash
Copy code
curl -sL https://repos.influxdata.com/influxdb.key | sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install influxdb

7. Monitoring and Alerts
Prometheus Node Exporter: To monitor system metrics (CPU, RAM, network) on each Raspberry Pi Zero, which can be used to monitor the health of your distributed system.
Installation:
bash
Copy code
wget https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter/releases/latest/download/node_exporter-1.x.x.linux-armv7.tar.gz
tar xvfz node_exporter-1.x.x.linux-armv7.tar.gz
./node_exporter

8. Mesh Network Tools
K3s (Lightweight Kubernetes): If you want to run Kubernetes pods on your Pi Zeros, K3s will manage pod deployments, scaling, and resource management.
Installation:
bash
Copy code
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -

9. Triangulation Algorithms
Custom Python scripts to implement triangulation based on RSSI values received from Bluetooth beacons. These scripts will use Python libraries like scipy for mathematical calculations.
Installation:
bash
Copy code
sudo pip3 install scipy


Summary of Software:
Raspberry Pi OS: Operating system.
BlueZ, pybluez, aioblescan: For Bluetooth and beacon scanning.
B.A.T.M.A.N. Advanced, dnsmasq: For Wi-Fi mesh networking.
MQTT (Mosquitto): For lightweight communication.
Node-RED: For flow-based data orchestration.
InfluxDB (optional): For edge data storage.
Prometheus Node Exporter: For monitoring system health.
K3s: For container orchestration (optional but useful for running pods).
Python, scipy: For custom triangulation scripts.


CI/CD Pipeline Planning:
Automated Deployment: Use GitHub Actions to automate the deployment of this software stack to your Raspberry Pi Zeros.
Configuration Management: Manage configurations (e.g., beacon scanning intervals, mesh network parameters) in a centralized repository, and push updates using CI/CD.
Rolling Updates: Implement rolling updates to minimize downtime when deploying new features or updates to the system.
