Using a Raspberry Pi (RPi) to integrate with your HotSpring Limelite Hot Tub's prewired speakers is a viable and potentially cost-effective solution. You can use the RPi as a media controller, and with an appropriate amplifier, you can drive the speakers, bypassing the high-cost proprietary systems.

Here’s an outline of how you can make this work:

Components You’ll Need:
Raspberry Pi:

Any model from Raspberry Pi 3 and upwards should work, but the Raspberry Pi 4 offers better performance and more ports if you need them.
The RPi will handle the audio playback, and you can stream music to it using Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or a wired connection.
Amplifier:

Since the hot tub’s speakers are passive (no built-in power), you'll need an amplifier to drive them. Look for a small form-factor stereo amplifier with enough wattage to power the speakers adequately.
Recommended options:
HiFiBerry Amp2: This is a popular amplifier designed to sit directly on top of the Raspberry Pi. It can output up to 60 watts per channel, which should be sufficient for most hot tub speaker setups.
Adafruit MAX9744: A 20W stereo amplifier that can be controlled via the RPi.
Dayton Audio DTA-2.1BT2: A small Bluetooth amplifier that could pair with your RPi wirelessly while still providing power to your speakers.
Power Supply:

You’ll need a power supply that can handle both the Raspberry Pi and the amplifier. The HiFiBerry Amp2, for example, requires a 12V-24V power supply. Check the specifications of your chosen amplifier to ensure you have the correct voltage and wattage.
Audio Output:

Bluetooth Audio Receiver: If you plan to stream audio from your phone, you can use the RPi as a Bluetooth receiver or a Wi-Fi audio streamer.
Software like Volumio or Raspberry Pi OS with PulseAudio: These can help you manage audio playback and integrate with the amplifier.
Step-by-Step Plan:
1. Set Up Raspberry Pi for Audio Streaming
Install Raspberry Pi OS or a dedicated media system like Volumio (which is tailored for audio streaming).
Volumio allows you to stream music from Bluetooth, Spotify, AirPlay, or DLNA.
If you stick with Raspberry Pi OS:
Use PulseAudio to manage audio streams.
Install Bluetooth Audio packages to allow your RPi to act as a Bluetooth speaker that can receive streams from your phone.
Connect the RPi to Wi-Fi or Ethernet for network-based streaming options.
2. Connect the Amplifier to the Raspberry Pi:
If you’re using something like the HiFiBerry Amp2, simply plug the amplifier board onto the RPi’s GPIO pins. This setup eliminates the need for external wiring between the RPi and the amplifier.
For external amplifiers (like the Dayton Audio or MAX9744), connect the audio output from the RPi (3.5mm jack or USB DAC) to the amplifier’s input and then wire the speakers to the amplifier’s output terminals.
3. Wiring the Hot Tub Speakers:
Check the specs of the speakers pre-installed in your hot tub. They are likely 4-ohm or 8-ohm speakers, which will determine the power requirements for the amplifier.
Wire the speakers to the amplifier’s output terminals, ensuring proper polarity and secure connections. If the amplifier has multiple output channels, map each speaker accordingly.
4. Power Up and Test the System:
Ensure both the RPi and amplifier are properly powered.
Once powered, the RPi should act as a Bluetooth or Wi-Fi audio receiver. Test it by pairing a Bluetooth device or streaming audio over Wi-Fi.
Adjust the audio settings (gain, balance, etc.) in your software to ensure proper sound distribution to all speakers.
Potential Challenges:
Waterproofing: Ensure the Raspberry Pi and amplifier are placed in a dry, well-ventilated area away from moisture.
Power Requirements: Be mindful of the power supply requirements for both the RPi and amplifier. Running both from the same power source might require a dedicated power supply with sufficient wattage.
Pros of This Solution:
Cost-effective: Using a Raspberry Pi and a small amplifier can be significantly cheaper than proprietary hot tub speaker systems.
Customizable: You can fully control the system, integrate it with Home Assistant (since you're already using it), and add features like voice control, smart home integration, or multi-room audio.
Scalable: You can easily expand the system with additional speakers, features, or services as needed.
Cons:
Installation complexity: Requires wiring and setup of the amplifier and RPi, as well as ensuring that the system is protected from water and moisture.
Audio quality: Depending on the amplifier and speakers, you may need to tune the system for optimal sound quality.
Summary of Components and Estimated Costs:
Raspberry Pi 4: $35-$55
Amplifier (HiFiBerry Amp2 or similar): $30-$60
Power supply: $10-$20
Wiring and connectors: $5-$10
Total cost: $80-$145, depending on the amplifier and components you choose.
