Here are some resources that will help you better understand and manage the various components of your project, from K3s, Node-RED, and InfluxDB, to Bluetooth beacon tracking:

1. Kubernetes (K3s) and Helm
Kubernetes Documentation:

The official Kubernetes documentation is a great place to start to understand how container orchestration works. It covers everything from basic concepts to advanced use cases.
For K3s, check out the K3s documentation by Rancher for a lighter version of Kubernetes suited for small setups.
Helm - The Kubernetes Package Manager:

Helm is a must-learn tool to manage and deploy applications in Kubernetes. The official Helm documentation will guide you on how to use Helm charts to simplify application deployment and management in Kubernetes.
You can also look at the Helm Hub to find pre-built charts for applications you might want to deploy (e.g., InfluxDB).
2. Node-RED
Node-RED Official Documentation:

Visit the Node-RED documentation to understand how to create flows, manage nodes, and integrate various IoT devices.
The Flow Library is a great resource to find reusable flows that can be helpful for your project: Node-RED Flow Library.
Tutorials:

Node-RED Essentials Playlist â€“ A beginner-friendly YouTube series that walks through the fundamentals.
For integrating Bluetooth devices (like your Minew beacons), explore Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) in Node-RED.
3. InfluxDB
InfluxDB Official Documentation:
The InfluxDB documentation provides everything you need to know about setting up, managing, and querying data in InfluxDB.
Explore Flux, InfluxDB's query language, which allows you to analyze time-series data: Flux Language Documentation.
InfluxDB University:
InfluxData offers free InfluxDB University courses that cover InfluxDB from basic setup to advanced data analytics. These are excellent for building a solid foundation on time-series databases and metrics collection.
4. Bluetooth Beacons and IoT Devices
Bluetooth Beacon Basics:
If you want to dive deeper into Bluetooth beacon technology, BeaconZone is an excellent resource with comprehensive guides on how beacons work, use cases, and how to integrate them into IoT systems.
Minew Bluetooth Beacons:
Minew's official documentation can help you understand how to configure and integrate your specific beacons and tags.
Explore tools like nRF Connect by Nordic Semiconductor to configure and debug Bluetooth beacons: nRF Connect.
5. IoT and Automation Platforms
MQTT Protocol:

Since you're working on an IoT system, you might want to study MQTT, a lightweight messaging protocol often used for IoT devices. HiveMQ's MQTT Essentials series is a great way to start.
Integrating MQTT with Node-RED can streamline communication between devices and your data pipeline.
Home Automation:

If you're looking for inspiration or want to tie your Dog Tracker into broader home automation, check out platforms like Home Assistant (Home Assistant) or OpenHAB (OpenHAB). These can integrate with Node-RED and Bluetooth beacons to extend functionality beyond just dog tracking.
6. Time-Series Data Analysis and Visualization
Grafana for Visualization:
Since you're using InfluxDB to store your tracking data, Grafana is an excellent tool for visualizing time-series data. The Grafana documentation can show you how to create real-time dashboards for tracking your dog's movements and other metrics.
Books & Courses:
"Mastering Kubernetes" by Gigi Sayfan: If you want an in-depth guide to managing Kubernetes, this book covers both basic and advanced Kubernetes usage.
"Designing Data-Intensive Applications" by Martin Kleppmann: This book offers a deep dive into designing systems that handle large amounts of data, including time-series databases like InfluxDB.
Udemy Courses:
Kubernetes for Developers: Search for highly-rated Kubernetes and Helm courses on Udemy to get hands-on experience with real-world applications.
By diving into these resources, you'll gain the knowledge you need to simplify and scale your Dog Tracker project while making it more efficient and feature-rich. Let me know if you'd like help with any specific topic!
