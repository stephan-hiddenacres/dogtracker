Estimating cost differentials between the various prototyping facilities in Georgia based on our discussions will depend on several factors, including the complexity of your project, production volume, materials used, and whether you need any additional services like testing or certifications.

Here’s an overview of general cost considerations for each facility type and what could influence those costs:

1. Georgia Tech Manufacturing Institute (GTMI)
Cost Range: Moderate to High
Details: As a research and innovation institute, GTMI typically focuses on advanced manufacturing and academic-driven projects. They offer comprehensive prototyping services with access to cutting-edge technologies.
Cost Drivers:
Academic/research-grade services can have higher costs, especially if utilizing specialized equipment like 3D printing or electronics fabrication.
Hourly rates for lab equipment use and expert consultation could range from $100 to $300/hour, depending on the service.
2. Prototype Prime
Cost Range: Low to Moderate
Details: As a startup incubator, Prototype Prime may offer more affordable services geared toward early-stage development. Their pricing could be more flexible for small-scale prototyping.
Cost Drivers:
3D printing and basic prototyping services can range from $50 to $200 per part, depending on the materials.
Consultation and design services will likely be affordable compared to other professional firms.
3. Georgia Center of Innovation for Manufacturing
Cost Range: Moderate
Details: The Center offers state-level support for manufacturers, often working with local companies to help scale ideas from prototypes to production.
Cost Drivers:
Services are likely subsidized for businesses in Georgia, making them more cost-effective.
Basic prototyping could cost between $500 to $5,000, depending on project scope and scale.
4. Plexus
Cost Range: High
Details: Plexus is a global electronics manufacturer with high-end prototyping and production capabilities. Costs here would be higher due to the scale and professional nature of their services.
Cost Drivers:
Electronics prototyping and product development could range from $5,000 to $50,000, especially if you're looking at end-to-end design, testing, and manufacturing.
For small-batch production, expect a higher entry cost due to their more industrial focus.
5. AutomationDirect’s Product Design and Prototyping Center
Cost Range: Moderate
Details: AutomationDirect specializes in automation and IoT systems, with a focus on efficient design and manufacturing.
Cost Drivers:
Custom IoT and automation prototypes can range from $3,000 to $10,000, depending on complexity and material choices.
