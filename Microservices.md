Dog Tracker project. These microservices are designed to operate efficiently in a distributed setup using Raspberry Pi Zeros, supporting your needs for data collection, processing, and communication.

1. Bluetooth Beacon Data Collection Service
Purpose: To continuously scan for Minew Bluetooth beacons attached to the dogs and collect RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) data.
Suggested Tools:
pybluez or aioblescan (for scanning).
BlueZ stack for handling Bluetooth on Linux.
Communication: Send collected data via MQTT to the central processing service.

2. MQTT Messaging Service
Purpose: To handle real-time, lightweight communication between Raspberry Pi Zeros, the central server, and potentially the mobile app.
Suggested Tools:
Mosquitto: A lightweight MQTT broker that runs well on Pi Zeros.
Functionality: Each Raspberry Pi can act as both a publisher (sending RSSI data) and a subscriber (receiving control commands or other signals).

3. Triangulation and Position Estimation Service
Purpose: To process RSSI values from multiple Pi Zeros and estimate the real-time position of each dog.
Suggested Tools:
Python with scipy for mathematical computations (e.g., trilateration).
Custom Python scripts running as a microservice to aggregate data and calculate positions.
Communication: Publish estimated positions to the database or over MQTT for real-time updates.

4. Data Aggregation and Processing Service
Purpose: To aggregate and store data collected from the Raspberry Pi Zeros.
Suggested Tools:
Node-RED: For data orchestration and integration with other services.
InfluxDB: For storing time-series data like RSSI values, calculated positions, and health metrics.
Functionality: Collect incoming data from all sources (beacons, triangulation service) and make it accessible for dashboards, queries, or alerts.

5. Data Storage Service
Purpose: To store all time-series data collected from Bluetooth beacons and processed position data for future analysis.
Suggested Tools:
InfluxDB: A highly efficient time-series database that can be used for storing all collected and processed data.
Functionality: Efficient data querying for dashboards, analytics, and long-term storage.

6. Monitoring and Alerting Service
Purpose: To monitor the health of the Pi Zeros (CPU usage, memory, network traffic) and send alerts if there are issues.
Suggested Tools:
Prometheus: For monitoring resource usage and exposing metrics.
Alertmanager: Integrated with Prometheus for handling alerts.
Functionality: Continuously monitor the system and send alerts if thresholds are crossed (e.g., a node going down or high CPU usage).

7. Visualization and Dashboard Service
Purpose: To visualize the data collected by the Dog Tracker system, including real-time positions of the dogs, historical movement data, and system health metrics.
Suggested Tools:
Grafana: For creating real-time dashboards based on data from InfluxDB and Prometheus.
Functionality: Allows users to view data through a web interface or mobile app.

8. Mobile App Integration Service
Purpose: To provide real-time dog tracking and system interaction via a mobile app.
Suggested Tools:
React Native or Flutter for cross-platform mobile app development.
MQTT client libraries for real-time communication between the app and backend services.
Functionality: Allow users to monitor dog positions, set alerts, and access system health metrics through their smartphones.

9. Mesh Network Management Service
Purpose: To manage the Wi-Fi mesh network across Raspberry Pi Zeros, ensuring smooth communication and data relay between nodes.
Suggested Tools:
B.A.T.M.A.N. Advanced: To handle mesh routing and manage the network.
Functionality: Ensure that data can be relayed efficiently across the Pi Zeros, even if one or more nodes fail.
