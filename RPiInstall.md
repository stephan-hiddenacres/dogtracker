# Raspberry Pi Zero Dog Tracker Setup

This guide outlines the steps to manually install and configure essential software packages on your Raspberry Pi Zero for the Dog Tracker project.

## 1. Update and Upgrade System

Always start by updating and upgrading your system:

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
2. Install K3s (Lightweight Kubernetes)
K3s will be used to manage the nodes in your dog tracker system. To install K3s:

bash
Copy code
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -
3. Install InfluxDB
InfluxDB will be used for time-series data storage. Install it using:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install influxdb
sudo systemctl start influxdb
sudo systemctl enable influxdb
4. Install Grafana
Grafana is needed for data visualization. To install it:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https
sudo apt-get install -y software-properties-common wget
wget -q -O - https://packages.grafana.com/gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -
sudo add-apt-repository "deb https://packages.grafana.com/oss/deb stable main"
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install grafana
sudo systemctl start grafana-server
sudo systemctl enable grafana-server
5. Install Node-RED
Node-RED will be used for managing the flow of data between your Raspberry Pi Zero and the dog tracker system.

bash
Copy code
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y nodejs npm
sudo npm install -g --unsafe-perm node-red
Start Node-RED with:

bash
Copy code
node-red-start
6. Install Prometheus
Prometheus is required for monitoring your nodes' performance. To install:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt-get install prometheus
sudo systemctl start prometheus
sudo systemctl enable prometheus
7. Install Mosquitto (MQTT Broker)
Mosquitto is the MQTT broker for handling data transfers between Raspberry Pi Zero nodes.

bash
Copy code
sudo apt-get install mosquitto mosquitto-clients
sudo systemctl start mosquitto
sudo systemctl enable mosquitto
8. Bluetooth Libraries
Since your dog tracker system involves Bluetooth communication with beacons, install Bluetooth libraries:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt-get install bluetooth bluez libbluetooth-dev
sudo systemctl enable bluetooth
sudo systemctl start bluetooth
9. Enable SSH
To remotely access your Raspberry Pi Zero, enable SSH:

bash
Copy code
sudo raspi-config
Navigate to Interfacing Options > SSH > Enable.

10. Power Management with UPS Hat
Make sure to install any monitoring scripts or software provided with your UPS hat to safely manage power and shutdowns. Refer to your UPS hat documentation for additional configuration steps.

These steps will get your Raspberry Pi Zero ready to function as part of the Dog Tracker system. If you have any questions or need further guidance, feel free to reach out!
